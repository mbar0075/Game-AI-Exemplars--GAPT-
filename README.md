## Description of Task:
The task involved the creation of small exemplars that were used to introduce Game AI concepts. These exemplars included demonstrations of simple movement in games, PathFinding, finite state machines, fuzzy logic, procedural content generation, and other related concepts. Each exemplar provided students with a practical opportunity to explore and understand these underlying concepts within the context of game development. The exemplars served as micro-level examples that allowed other students to gain hands-on experience and learn from real-world scenarios. The Unity gaming engine was selected as the preferred platform for developing these exemplars, leveraging its capabilities to showcase immersive and interactive experiences.
